# Statistical Analysis of Stack Overflow 2020 Survey of Software Developers

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Every year, the Stack Overflow company conducts a word-wide survey of software developers.  The survey collects information on wide variety of topics.  I plan to analyse the survey information on certain aspects, including compensation, education, employment, and gender. Like most other surveys, many repondents have not answered several questions.  I intend to use pre-processing techniques before doing some preliminary analysis.  I will focus on: (1). impute missing values whenever possible, (2) Use Python and Pandas to create GroupBy tables.  I will also draw some basic plots, such as Scatter Diagram, Bar Chart, and Histogram.


## Background

It will provide summary statistics to Software Developers and to other professional working in Information Technology and Data Science.  It will help us understand how different groups of employees differ in their compensation, education, working hours and so on.  We can also explore the trend overtime.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
