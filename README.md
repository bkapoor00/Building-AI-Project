# Stdudy of Emerging Technologies in Data Science and Machine Learning

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Data Science, Machine Learning and related Technologies are moving at a fast pace as it contributes to create innovative products and services.  As a result the demand for data scientists is increasing accoross a wide range of sectors.  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 11.5 million jobs in data science will be created by 2026.  In this project, I plan to study the major tools and technologies commonly used or wanted in this area.


## Background

Every year, the Stack Overflow company conducts a word-wide survey of software developers.  The survey collects information on wide variety of topics.  I plan to analyse the 2020 survey information on the following topics for the US deveopers:

1. Most commonly used and wanted programming, scripting and markup languages (e.g., Python, and HTML/CSS)
2. Most commonly used and wanted Frameworks (e.g., ASP.net, jquery, and Ruby on Rails)
3. Most commonly used and wanted databases (e.g., MySQL, MS SQL Server, and Oracle)
4. Highest paying Technologies

These issues are important not only to the existing data science professionals and their employers, but also to students, prespective employees, and educational institutions.

I intend to use pre-processing techniques before doing some preliminary analysis and data modeling.  I will focus on: (1). imputing missing values whenever possible, (2) Use Python and Pandas to create summary statistics and GroupBy tables.  I will also draw some basic plots, such as Scatter Diagram, Bar Chart, Box Plot, Heat Maps, and Histogram.


## How is it used?

The existing data science professionals and their employers, students, prespective employees, and educational institutions will be welcome to use the results to their benefit.

## Data sources and AI methods
The primary source of data for analysis will be:

The open source Stackoverflow developer survey, 2020:

Data Visualization Techiques, Machine Learning techiques for regression and Classification will be considered for the project.

## Challenges

Like most other surveys, many repondents have not answered several questions.  I intend to use pre-processing techniques before doing some preliminary analysis.  I impute missing values whenever possible. Special attention will be paid to categorical variables.  I plan to use 'One 
Hot Encoding' to code nominal and ordinal type predictors.
## What next?

I will restrict the analysis to the US developers only.  later, I may widen the scope to other developers as well.
